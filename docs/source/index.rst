Welcome to Chimera's documentation!
===================================

Chimera is a framework for publishing games through a `websockets <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket>`__-based API, allowing users to play games remotely through a variety of interfaces (web, mobile, desktop, etc.). It was developed at the `University of Chicago's Department of Computer Science <https://www.cs.uchicago.edu/>`__ to support course projects, allowing students to explore topics in software design, APIs, networked applications, etc.

This site currently only includes reference documentation, but will eventually include tutorials, details about Chimera's architecture, etc.
